# Basic Java Concepts

**Class**: It's a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes/fields) and behaviors (methods) of objects. Objects are instances of classes.

**Object**: An instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and has state (attributes) and behavior (methods).

**Method**: A block of code that performs a specific task. Methods are defined within a class and are used to define the behavior of objects.

**Variable**: A named storage location in memory that holds data. Variables have a data type (such as int, double, String) and can store different values.

**Data Types**: Defines the type of data that a variable can hold, such as int, double, char, boolean, etc. Java has primitive data types and reference data types.

**Primitive Data Types**: Basic data types in Java that hold single values. Examples include int, double, char, boolean, etc.

**Reference Data Types**: Types that refer to objects. Examples include String, arrays, classes, interfaces, etc.

**Constructor**: Special methods used for initializing objects. They have the same name as the class and are invoked when an object of that class is created.

**Inheritance**: A mechanism in Java where a class inherits properties and behaviors from another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a parent-child relationship between classes.

**Polymorphism**: The ability of an object to take on multiple forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

**Encapsulation**: The concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class). It hides the internal state of an object and restricts access to it.

**Abstraction**: It refers to the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only essential features of an object.

**Interface**: A reference type in Java that contains abstract methods. Classes implement interfaces and provide implementations for the methods defined in the interface.

**Package**: A way to organize classes and interfaces into namespaces. It helps in avoiding naming conflicts and provides better modularity and maintainability.
