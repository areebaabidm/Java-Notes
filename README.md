# Introduction

## What is Java?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, which is now owned by Oracle Corporation. It was first released in 1995 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. Java is known for its platform independence, meaning that once a program is written in Java, it can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.

## What are some of the Key Features of Java?

1. **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**: Java programs are compiled into bytecode that can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine, offering a high level of portability.
2. **Object-Oriented**: Java is designed around the concept of objects and classes, making it easy to organize and structure code.
3. **Robust and Secure**: Java is built with a strong emphasis on reliability and security. It includes features like garbage collection to manage memory, exception handling, and a strong type system to prevent common programming errors.
4. **Large Standard Library**: Java comes with a vast standard library that provides pre-built functionalities for various tasks, reducing the need for developers to write code from scratch.
5. **Multithreading**: Java supports concurrent programming by allowing multiple threads to execute simultaneously, enhancing performance and responsiveness in applications.
6. **Community Support**: Java has a large and active developer community that contributes to its ecosystem with frameworks, libraries, and tools, making it versatile for various applications, from web development to mobile apps, enterprise software, and more.

## Where is Java used?

Java is widely used in various domains such as web development (with frameworks like Spring and Hibernate), mobile app development (Android apps are primarily built using Java), enterprise software development, scientific applications, and more due to its versatility, performance, and scalability.
